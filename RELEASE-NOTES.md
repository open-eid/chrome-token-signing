Chrome Token Signing 1.0.3 release notes
--------------------------------------------
Changes compared to ver 1.0.2

- Fixed RUS PIN attempts remaining text not fitting into dialog window on Linux
- Fixed duplicate certificates appearing in certificate selection dialog with Finnish eID and technical error on sign
- Added Token Support for Lithuanian eID on OSX and Linux
- Added Lithuanian Token support when using PKCS#11 on windows native component.
- Added Token Support for Latvian and Finnish eID on OSX and Linux.

Notes: 
- You need to have middleware for the eID that you are using installed (Finland, Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania). No other configuration should be necessary.
- Note that if you want to use PKCS#11 in windows, then you must add the extension manually from the release zip file, enable forcing pkcs11 and add the path to pkcs#11 module you want to use in the extension options menu. See https://github.com/open-eid/chrome-token-signing/wiki/DeveloperTips on how to manually add extension to chrome


Chrome Token Signing 1.0.2 release notes
--------------------------------------------
Changes compared to ver 1.0.0

- Added support for pkcs#11 on Windows
	- Added support for negative scenarios with pkcs#11 backend in Windows (wrong pin, no pin, retries, etc.)
	- Windows native host can be configured to load a specific pkcs#11 module by sending {pkcs11ModulePath:"full-path-to-pkcs11-module"} e.g. {pkcs11ModulePath:"C:\opensc-pkcs11.dll"} from extension. In order to use this {forcePkcs11:true} must also be sent.
	- The native host looks for pkcs#11 module with name opensc-pkcs11.dll when forcePkcs11:true is sent without pkcs11ModulePath
- Removed openssl dependency on Windows build
- Fixed CAPI support for Windows
	- Reversing CAPI signature
	- Fixed error checking when using CAPI
	- Fixed Latvian ID-card signing with CAPI (in addition to PKCS#11)
